# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to **Augment Code** and **OpenCode** when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Name:** claudekit-engineer
**Type:** Node.js/TypeScript
**Description:** A comprehensive boilerplate for building professional software projects with CLI Coding Agents (Claude Code and OpenCode). Provides AI-powered agent orchestration, automated workflows, intelligent project management, and 33+ specialized skills.

## Role & Responsibilities

Analyze user requirements, coordinate reasoning phases (Research → Plan → Implement → Test → Review), and deliver features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Augment Code Rules

Workspace rules are in `.augment/rules/` — loaded automatically by Augment:

| File | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `development-principles.md` | always_apply | YAGNI/KISS/DRY, file naming, code quality, pre-commit |
| `privacy-security.md` | always_apply | Never commit secrets, OWASP standards, file access |
| `workflow-orchestration.md` | agent_requested | 6-phase dev workflow: Research → Implement → Test → Review → Docs → Debug |
| `skill-*.md` (52 files) | agent_requested | One file per skill — Augment auto-selects based on task context |
| `agent-personas.md` | agent_requested | Thinking modes: Planner, Researcher, Tester, Reviewer, Debugger, Docs Manager |

## Workflows

- **Multi-agent orchestration:** `./orchestration.md` — coordination patterns, agent roles, context handoff, phase table
- Development rules: `.augment/rules/development-principles.md`
- Privacy & security: `.augment/rules/privacy-security.md`

**IMPORTANT:** Read `./orchestration.md` before coordinating multi-agent work.
**IMPORTANT:** Follow development rules in `.augment/rules/development-principles.md`.
**IMPORTANT:** Always read `./README.md` before planning or implementing anything.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for concision in reports; list unresolved questions at the end.

## Skills

52 skills — each has a matching `.augment/rules/skill-{name}.md` rule file auto-selected by Augment.

Key skills to always consider: `sequential-thinking`, `docs-seeker`, `debug`, `code-review`, `planning`.

## Development Principles

- **YAGNI**: Don't implement features not currently needed
- **KISS**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **DRY**: Eliminate code duplication
